Plans provide product clients with a predefined set of service options. 

Please note that we regularly update the service plan feature and introduce new flows and attributes. Your customer service flow and solutions may undergo changes due to an extensive system update. In the latest update we added new properties. For reference see our API 1.1 specification. 
One of the major changes is the new *sub_status* user attribute.  This attribute is applied only to users in the *signing* status and depends on whether a user confirmed/declined new service plan purchase.

The set of plans and the number of plans of each type per provider is limited. You can create various plan offerings of the same type and customize them up to a desirable extent. 
The number of *guest* and *admin* user accounts is unlimited.

 Our selection of service plan attributes complies with the law requirements in each country of presence and is up to the industry standards.
